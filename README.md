## Notes

I had a lot of fun working on this project. For the state management of the form, I used Xstate, which also handled the input validation. Although there were some cases where I wish I had more time to work on, I'm pretty happy with the end result. My focus was not too much on the styling; I wanted to cover the whole range of the development process. Fortunately, I was able to get the event listening to work as well. It was worth the challenge, and I'm glad it was mentioned.
